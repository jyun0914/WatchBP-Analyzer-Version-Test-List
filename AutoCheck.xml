<changelog> To enhance cybersecurity, WatchBP Analyzer V1.7.0.0 will introduce database encryption. During installation, WatchBP Analyzer will automatically create a backup of your current unencrypted database.
Please note that once you start using WatchBP Analyzer V1.7.0.0, if you need to roll back to a previous version, the older software will be unable to read the encrypted database, resulting in operational failure. Therefore, you must use the unencrypted database backup when rolling back to a previous version.
Thank you for your understanding and support.</changelog>
